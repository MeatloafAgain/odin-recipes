        Carp is a wonderful game fish! However, cooking your Carp
        is a little tricky.  The flesh of a carp is filled with lots
        of little bones. There's too many to pick out, so you need to ensure
        that you cook your carp long enough for the bones to bake into mush
        without burning the rest of the carp.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sounds impossible doesn't it?  But I assure you, it can be done
        with this one weird trick... You stuff it with a brick! The brick provides
        enough thermal mass that the flesh doesn't burn while the bones
        are cooking down.

    <h2>Stuff You're Gonna Need (Ingredients)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A carp</li>
        <li>A (reasonably) clean brick</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Soak your brick in water for a few minutes. This helps to steam the carp from the inside.</li>
        <li>Grease a 9x13 baking dish and place the cleaned (you did already clean it right?) carp in the pan.</li>
        <li>Place the brick inside the carp.</li>
        <li>Season the carp to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>When your oven has come up to temparature, place the pan in the over for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 45 minutes, use a fork and see if the brick is tender yet.</li>
        <li>If it isn't, put it back in the over for another 15 minutes and check again.</li>
        <li>When the brick feels tender to the fork, you can remove the pan from the oven.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the brick and place it on a serving dish. You can throw the carp away - it will still be inedible.</li>
        <li>Think about all the minerals you're getting!</li>

    </ol>
