    <p>
        This is for all you folks who never learned how to cook and say
        you wouldn't know how to boil water.
    </p>
    <p>
        This can also come on handy if you're in a 1940's film and your
        wife is having a baby. Boiling water was critically important
        during that era. You're welcome.
